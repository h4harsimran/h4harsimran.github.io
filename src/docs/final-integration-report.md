### ✅ Sub-task 2: Perform final performance optimization and bundle analysis

**Completed:**

- ✅ Configured Vite build optimization with manual chunks
- ✅ Implemented code splitting with React.lazy()
- ✅ Added Suspense boundaries for lazy-loaded sections
- ✅ Bundle analysis shows proper chunk separation:
  - `react-vendor`: 11.79 kB (React core)
  - `animation-vendor`: 186.53 kB (GSAP + Framer Motion)
  - `ui-vendor`: 2.50 kB (UI libraries)
  - `utils-vendor`: 7.89 kB (Utilities)
  - `index`: 1,583.98 kB (Main application)

**Performance Optimizations:**

- Lazy loading for non-critical sections
